1. Windows

Easiest: download from the official site → git-scm.com

Run the installer (Git for Windows) → it includes Git Bash (the terminal you were using earlier).

After install, check with:

git --version

2. macOS

Two options:
a. Using Homebrew (recommended if you have it):

brew install git


b. Without Homebrew:

Download installer from git-scm.com

Then confirm:

git --version

3. Linux (varies a bit by distribution):

Debian/Ubuntu:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install git


Fedora:

sudo dnf install git


Arch Linux:

sudo pacman -S git


Check with:

git --version


✨ Quick tip: Git often comes pre-installed on Mac and many Linux systems, so you may just need to type git --version to check before installing.
